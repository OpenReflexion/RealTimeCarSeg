### Overview

RealTimeCarSeg leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to detect and classify car parts in real-time from video feeds. This project is aimed at enhancing vehicle maintenance systems by providing detailed insights into the condition and identity of vehicle components.

### Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilize object detection models to identify vehicles in images and videos in real time.
- **Part Segmentation**: Segment and identify various car parts, such as headlights, mirrors, wheels, and doors.
- **Brand Identification**: Classify the brands and models of detected vehicles.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect anomalies and potential failures in car parts for proactive maintenance.
- **Advanced Technologies**: Utilizes TensorFlow for deep learning and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

### Installation

To get started with RealTimeCarSeg, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/OpenReflexion/RealTimeCarSeg.git
    cd RealTimeCarSeg
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the necessary pre-trained models**:
    - [YOLO Weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
    - [Mask R-CNN Weights](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases)

### Usage

1. **Prepare your video data**: Place your video files in the `data/videos` directory.

2. **Run the detection script**:
    ```sh
    python detect_and_classify.py --input data/videos/your_video.mp4 --output data/output/your_output_video.avi
    ```

3. **View the results**: Processed videos with detected and classified car parts will be saved in the `data/output` directory.
